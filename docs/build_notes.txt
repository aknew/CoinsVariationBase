My current goal is supporting system which I actually works on. What I rewally try:
macOS Mojave + qt 5.12/5.13
iOS 12 + qt 5.11 
I cannot use qt 5.12 for iOS because it doesn't contains Controls 1 and Dialogs (see https://forum.qt.io/topic/98309/qt-5-12-0-qml-ios-qtquick-dialogs-qtquick-dialogs-private-is-not-installed) and qt 5.11 for macOS (it doesn't work with mojave +)& Alterantive way https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qt-labs-platform-filedialog.html#details doesn't workable for android

Known issues:

I don't know why, but I can't run this project on iOs Simulator with Qt Creator. Solution: create Xcode project with ~/Qt/5.5/ios/bin/qmake -spec macx-xcode CoinsBases.pro

Add UIFileSharingEnabled with value YES to generated info.plist to share files via iTunes. I actually don't want to add all generated files to git, but docs (https://wiki.qt.io/Support_for_iOS) says that I can't do it via pro file


Building for Win XP:
qt 5.7 needs
collect dlls with
build-CoinsBases-Desktop_Qt_5_7_1_MinGW_32bit2-Release\release>windeployqt --compiler-runtime --no-translations CoinsBases.exe 
copy Qt,  QtQML, QtQuick and QtQuick2 from C:\Qt\5.7\mingw53_32\qml and  Qt5QuickTemplates2.dll Qt5QuickControls2.dll
