
When I started this project I just wanted to create a database of Russian Imperia's coins with sqlite as data storage. After that I wanted to have ability to change database structure simple way, so I added some structure description in code and used QTableView to display data. Next step was creating struct.json as separate base structure description instead hardcoded one (because I didn't want to recompile all if I just need add one field to table, especially for few platforms - I used Windows and Ubuntu and also started to use Android, and, actually I had some trouble with recompiling/uploading new app's versions to android Phone) and using dinamicly generated qml as GUI (QTableView wasn't good on Android and styling didn't working, but it was in Necessitas time and Android port of Qt actually wasn't beta yet). Next I just began used my application with few bases and got something like simplify (or reduced? :) ) MS Access.

If someone plans to look throw sources, he should remember that this project is just pet project (so I can't spend a lot time to it), it was started with Qt 4.7 and a lot of used components (like Qt.Controls and android support) were unstable when it was firtly used, so it can be a lot dirty hacks in code (I tryed to remove it, but I don't sure that I removed all). Also a documentation (except doxyged comments) is only in Russian because I am working alone and it is my native language. English translation is just in plans

I have found and reported [few Qt' bugs](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTCREATORBUG-15742?jql=reporter%20%3D%20aknew85) while making this application, also [qml and QSqlTableModel example](https://wiki.qt.io/QML_and_QSqlTableModel) had been modified according to [my question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14613824/qsqltablemodel-inheritor-and-qtableview)
